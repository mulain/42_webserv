- cgi
- delete requests
- include parsing for query string
- update main to handle multiple host:port combos
- check throws. Probably should always result in client closing (file deletion also if post request)

- capture SIGINT and clean up memory and fd (basically just call the server destructors)

- A request to your server should never hang forever.

testing:
- siege test
- catch of server handling (shutting down servers on running main, keeping the rest)
- http redirection
- correct serving of standard-serve files
