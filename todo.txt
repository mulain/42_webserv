- fix dir listing
- cgi

- remove CGI paths from config file

- setup normal hp for single upload (non multipart msg)
- error with reloading (problem is: POLLOUT is active but no reqeust was received)
	- check listen fds (unlikely)
	- deactivate instaClose upon POLLOUT first detection

testing:
- check eval sheet questions
