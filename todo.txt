- merge dir listing
- cgi
- delete requests
- update main to handle multiple host:port combos
- check throws. Probably should always result in client closing (file deletion also if post request)
- think about return from sendBody on sendpathempty in context of physiological emptiness.


- capture SIGINT and clean up memory and fd (basically just call the server destructors)

actively tell clients wanting to connect on connection limit reached to fuck off? happens automatically?

testing:
- siege test
- catch of server handling (shutting down servers on running main, keeping the rest)
- http redirection
- correct serving of standard-serve files
