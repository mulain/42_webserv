- cgi

testing:
- check eval sheet questions
- host redirections
- multiple servers running smoothly
- check throws. maybe just senderror. but at least close client in some cases

Copy Paste for testing with curl / siege
curl -H "host: shmang.co" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/upload/text.txt
siege -b http://localhost:8080

For a rainy day post eval:
- refactor main loop due and server::handleconns to poll event ordering
- refactor serverconfig to complete all steps
- server class becomes just one big server that deals with all connections and loads serverconfigs depending on port and hostname
- tempfiles create problems if not sent in one go: the next client might overwrite it with their data.
